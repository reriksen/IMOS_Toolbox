# IMOS_Toolbox
A repo for useful code related to downloading, analysing and plotting IMOS data


### Satellite Data

**NOTE:** If you are on a Windows PC - You will need to install a development version of ncdf4 which allows the use of OpenDAP. Please run ```devtools::install_github('mdsumner/ncdf4')``` to install or see https://github.com/mdsumner/ncdf4 for more information.

fIMOS_MatchMODIS.R is a function which does all the heavy lifting. It will download any MODIS data from the IMOS DAP Server

fIMOS_MatchAltimetry.R is a function which downloads Altimtery data from the IMOS DAP server

Example_MatchSat_2_NRS.R is a parent script which can be used to run and test the download of satellite data

TestData* is a test data file (NRS Zooplankton Higher Trophic Levels) as a source of lat/lon/date for the satellite data download.

### Plankton Data

In progress. Code will take the low level files from the AODN Portal and create merged products, indices etc.

### Long time series moorings data

Some example code for plotting from the hourly time series and gridded time series products from the NRS stations (these use other instruments from these locations).
